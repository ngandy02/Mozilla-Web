     <p class="editor-note">My cat is very grumpy</p>
     The "class" is the attribute name:
          - Allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it 
            (and any other elements with the same "class" value) with style information and other things
          - Some attributes have no values, such as "required"
     The "editor-note" is the attribute value

<!-- LINKS-->
<!-- Links establishes a web
    To add a link we use the simple element <a> 'a' being short for "anchor"
    To make text within your paragraph into a link:
      1) Choose some text
      2) Wrap the text in an <a> element 
      3) Give the <a> element an 'href' attribute 
      4) Fill in the value of the attribute with the web address that you want the link to point to

<!-- Introduction to HTML-->
<!-- <img> element -->
<!--
The <img> element can take a number of attributes, including:
- src
- alt
- width : specifies the width of the image with unit being pixels 
- height : specifies the height of the image with the unit being pixels 
-->

<!-- Boolean attributes-->
<!-- 
  - Are attributes sometimes written without values
  - Can only have one value, which is generally the same as the attribute name
  - For example, the "disabled" attribute:
      - <input type="text" disabled="disabled" />
      in this 'input' element, the text box or input box is disabled, 
      meaning the user can't make entries and the element/textbox is grayed-out

      - <input type="text" disabled />
      simply using the distabled attribute will also prevent the end user from 
      entering text into the input box

      - <input type="text" />
      the input element doesn't contain the disabled attribute, so text input is allowed
-->

<!-- Anchor '<a>' Element-->
<!--
  - Anchors enclose text and turn them into links
  - the hred attribute specifies the web address the link points to 
  - Example: 
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/"">favorite website</a>
  - Anchors can also have a title attribute, a desciption of the linked page
  - When attempting to use the same type of quotes inside the same type of quotes you have to use '&quot;'
        - Example:
            Wrong way: <a href="https://www.example.com" title="An "interesting" reference">A link to my example.</a>
            Correct way:
                  <a href="https://www.example.com" title="An &quot;interesting&quot; reference">A link to my example.</a>
-->

<!-- Whitespace in HTML-->
<!-- 
  - No matter how much whitespace you use inside HTML element content, the HTML parser
  reduces each sequence of whitespace to a single space when rendering the code 
  - 
-->

<!-- Literal Characters and Character Reference Equivalent-->
<!-- 
  1) < equals &lt;
  2) > equals &gt;
  3) " equals &quot;
  4) ' equals &apos;
  5) & equals &amp;
